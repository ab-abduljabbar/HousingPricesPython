This is my python project.
This project contains core python pandas concepts. 
First of all after uploading the file i checked the data type, then if there are any nulls in the data frame. 
In my case there were no nulls so I did not do anything with it, but if there were any nulls I would have changed it with mean values to keep the data integrity. 
Most solumns contained string values, so I had to change it to booleans because later I wanted to make a correlation. 
When replacing the values, I found its correlation and then heat map using seaborn. 
Using seaborn again I created a bar graph and increased its size. 
lastly, using matplotlib I created a line graph then found regression using sklearn library.
The regression was 0.287 so I can deduce that data is not very correlated. 

Thanks for viewing my project.
